```
themes/your-theme/html/MauticEmailThreadsBundle/
â”œâ”€â”€ Default/

    â””â”€â”€ thread_embed.html.php
```

### JavaScript

Extend functionality with custom JavaScript:

```javascript
// Access plugin functionality
EmailThreads.config.refreshInterval = 60000; // Custom refresh interval
EmailThreads.loadThreads(true); // Force refresh
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Threads Not Creating**
   - Verify plugin is enabled in configuration
   - Check that emails are being sent successfully
   - Ensure database tables were created during installation

2. **Public Links Not Working**
   - Verify public domain configuration
   - Check web server URL rewriting rules
   - Ensure proper file permissions

3. **Database Errors**
   - Run `php app/console cache:clear`
   - Check database table creation
   - Verify database user permissions

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by adding to your local.php:

```php
'emailthreads_debug' => true,
```

### Performance Optimization

For high-volume installations:

1. **Database Indexing**: Ensure proper indexes on thread and message tables
2. **Cache Strategy**: Consider implementing thread caching
3. **Cleanup Schedule**: Set up regular cleanup of old threads
